Woke up early again today.
7:30 AM feels kind of early for me lately, but I think the sunlight creeping through the curtains sadly nudged me out of bed.
Coffee was good this morning, too good actually.
Now I'm kind of jittery.
Spent a good chunk of the day reading for class with my best friend.
He didn't do his job today though, kept getting distracted by random thoughts.
I ended up taking a break and watching some random videos online.
Met up with some friends in the evening.
-
We just hung out, walked around the city, talked about life stuff, plans, whatever.
It's never deep, but I like that.
The lighter conversations are the most fun.
It's nice being with people who just get it without much effort.
-
Got back home pretty late, I'm tired but content.
It's one of those days where you don't feel like you did much, but when you think about it, it feels like enough.
