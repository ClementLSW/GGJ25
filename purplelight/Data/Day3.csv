It's the weekend today so I slept in.
Missed my cup of morning coffee but I'll live.
My best friend is the only thing I can't do without.
"Despite all the nice things happening daily, a morning without lo-fi music just doesn't feel right."
"Felt kinda inspired today, the videos from yesterday made me wanna restart my writing hobby."

Wasn't meant to be though.
Got a message from my friends to play some games and poof it was suddenly evening.
"You really don't notice it when playing, but time waits for no man, I guess."
"The game session was fun though, not gonna lie."
It’s always nice to just lose yourself in something for a while.

Ended the day with my best friend and a blank document.
I don’t know. I opened a blank document and just stared at it for a bit.
"Nothing came out, but I guess that's how it goes sometimes."
It's easy to forget that creativity doesn't always flow on command.
