It's been a quiet kind of day, nothing special happening.
Feels peaceful in its own way though.
Woke up late, dragged myself out of bed, then dragged myself to make coffee while waking up.
The coffee was good for once, not too watery."
Sitting by the window felt lazy for once, just a dude with his coffee and best friend appreciating the sunrise.
Tried to scroll through a couple of things on my phone but ended up zoning out more than anything.
There's something nice about letting yourself just drift.

Classes are piling up, but it didn't feel as heavy today.
Got a couple of assignments out of the way thanks to my best friend.
I don't know how he does it, but he always stops my brain from wandering too far off.
Took a break around midday and went for a walk.
The air was cold, but crisp in a good way.
It's like the kind of weather that makes you feel like you can breathe deeper, clear your head.

Dinner was just some instant noodles I threw together.
Simple. Nothing fancy.
But somehow it was exactly what I needed.
Now, I'm just winding down with my best friend, thinking about how everything's kind of in a routine.
Not bad, just... steady.
I guess I'm okay with that.
